The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).<br/><br/>\n\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cimar-books/contents/cimar-books\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/how-we-use-our-data/deaths-data\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>SUDO has spatially enabled the original data.</li>\n<li>Due to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.</li>\n<li>Values assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.</li>\n<li>The Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA.
